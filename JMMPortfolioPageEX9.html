				<p><h3 id="bio">I grew up in Indiana and moved to Music City in 1992.  <br>I joined a band and got to take the ride of my life.<br>
				BR5-49 allowed me to travel the world. I got to live out a dream.<br>
				The events of 9/11/2001 caused me to reevaluate my situation and<br />
				I realized I wanted to start a family and stay home to enjoy it.<br>
				We now have 3 wonderful kids.  Riley, 8, Harper, 6 and Drake, 4.</h3></p>

The beginning of Bob Seger's "Old Time Rock and Roll", that's Barry.  In the middle of "I'll Take You There" by The Staple Singers, Mavis Staples namechecks Barry.  Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Hank, Jr., Kenny Chesney, Aretha Franklin, Bob Seger, is just the beginning of the list that considered Barry a friend as well as a "go to" guy in the studio.</h3>
